# Cosmetic-Recommendation
Sephora skin care recommendation system based on ingredients 

## Introduction
<br>
We all love trying new makeup products, but it's a different story when it comes to skin care. Throughout our lives, we encounter with many types of skin problems such as acne, aging, dark circles and allergy. At these times we need to switch up our routines, change products or add new products. When we buy new products, it's hard to understand product ingredients and we don't know if it will suit on our skin. So instead of taking a high risk, it would be better to try a product that has similar ingredients to what you have been using before.
